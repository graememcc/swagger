swagger requires:
* Python 2.X
* GitPython - https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython
* a git checkout of mozilla-central - https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central

The first run will take ~5 minutes and seed a committers.db sqlite3 database with all commit metadata
from the repository provided on the commandline. Subsequent runs will update the database with data
from any new commits present in the repository since the last time swagger was run. This will print
out a list of email addresses corresponding to first commits in this period.

To look at historical data, open up committers.db in sqlite3. Every entry in the committers table
contains a first_commit and last_commit timestamp, so you can search within date ranges.

Please enjoy responsibly.
